## Live Data Integration

### Dillon Gage Fiztrade API

- **Production token**: stored as `DILLON_GAGE_API_KEY` env var (`1119-...`)
- **Staging token**: `1466-...` — staged but not yet activated by Dillon Gage; staging environment is incomplete
- **Working endpoint**: `GET https://connect.fiztrade.com/FizServices/GetSpotPriceData/{token}` — returns live gold/silver/platinum/palladium prices with daily changes
- **Account**: WEST HILLS CAPITAL, LLC — Account #167542
- **Cache**: 5-second TTL in-memory cache on the backend
- **Blocked endpoints**: `GetProductCatalog` and `GetPricesForProducts` crash with 500 (NullReferenceException on Dillon Gage's server) because the 3 products have not been added as "favorites" in the Fiztrade portal (connect.fiztrade.com). Once configured, these endpoints will return product images, account-specific pricing, and availability.

### Dillon Gage Product Codes (confirmed from existing WordPress site)

These are the exact Fiztrade product codes for the 3 featured products. They are documented in `pricing.ts` and ready to use with `GetPricesForProducts` once portal setup is complete:

| Product | Fiztrade Code |
|---|---|
| 1 oz American Gold Eagle | `1EAGLE` |
| 1 oz American Gold Buffalo | `1B` |
| 1 oz American Silver Eagle (Random Year) | `SE` |

### Pricing configuration

- Gold spread: +2% over spot bid
- Silver spread: +5% over spot bid
- Gold buyback: -1% from spot
- Silver buyback: -3% from spot

## Database

- **Platform**: Replit built-in PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_URL` env var)
- **Tables**:
  - `leads` — All form submissions from Schedule and IRA pages
  - `appointments` — All booked calls with confirmation IDs, used to prevent double-booking

## Email Notifications (Pending)

- SendGrid integration was declined (user dismissed the Replit connector)
- To add email confirmations later:
  - Option A: Connect SendGrid via Replit integrations (ask agent to "add SendGrid email")
  - Option B: Provide a `SENDGRID_API_KEY` directly so it can be stored as a secret
- Hook points already exist in `leads.ts` and `scheduling.ts` (add send logic after DB inserts)

## Google Calendar (Pending)

- The scheduling system uses deterministic time slot generation (Mon-Fri 9am-5pm CT)
- Booked slots are excluded via DB query — no double-booking is possible
- To integrate real Google Calendar availability:
  - Connect Google Calendar via Replit integrations (ask agent to "add Google Calendar")
  - The agent will query freebusy and create calendar events on booking

## Business Rules

- NO cart, checkout, or payment flows
- ALL trades require verbal confirmation and cleared funds
- Phone 800-867-6768 must appear in header, footer, and confirmation screens
- No fear marketing, countdown timers, or "limited supply" language
- Products: 1oz Gold American Eagle, 1oz Gold American Buffalo, 1oz Silver American Eagle
