# Workspace

## Overview

pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript. Each package manages its own dependencies.

## Project: West Hills Capital

West Hills Capital is a physical gold and silver allocation company. The website is a production-ready site with live Dillon Gage pricing, a 2-step appointment scheduling flow, an IRA allocation section, and a 12-article Insights educational hub.

## Live Data Integration

### Dillon Gage Fiztrade API

- **Production token**: stored as `DILLON_GAGE_API_KEY` env var (`1119-...`)
- **Staging token**: `1466-...` — staged but not yet activated by Dillon Gage; staging environment is incomplete
- **Working endpoint**: `GET https://connect.fiztrade.com/FizServices/GetSpotPriceData/{token}` — returns live gold/silver/platinum/palladium prices with daily changes
- **Account**: WEST HILLS CAPITAL, LLC — Account #167542
- **Cache**: 5-second TTL in-memory cache on the backend
- **Blocked endpoints**: `GetProductCatalog` and `GetPricesForProducts` crash with 500 (NullReferenceException on Dillon Gage's server) because the 3 products have not been added as "favorites" in the Fiztrade portal (connect.fiztrade.com). Once configured, these endpoints will return product images, account-specific pricing, and availability.

### Dillon Gage Product Codes (confirmed from existing WordPress site)

These are the exact Fiztrade product codes for the 3 featured products. They are documented in `pricing.ts` and ready to use with `GetPricesForProducts` once portal setup is complete:

| Product | Fiztrade Code |
|---|---|
| 1 oz American Gold Eagle | `1EAGLE` |
| 1 oz American Gold Buffalo | `1B` |
| 1 oz American Silver Eagle (Random Year) | `SE` |

### Pricing configuration

- Gold spread: +2% over spot bid
- Silver spread: +5% over spot bid
- Gold buyback: -1% from spot
- Silver buyback: -3% from spot

## Database

- **Platform**: Replit built-in PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_URL` env var)
- **Tables**:
  - `leads` — All form submissions from Schedule and IRA pages
  - `appointments` — All booked calls with confirmation IDs, used to prevent double-booking

## Email Notifications (Pending)

- SendGrid integration was declined (user dismissed the Replit connector)
- To add email confirmations later:
  - Option A: Connect SendGrid via Replit integrations (ask agent to "add SendGrid email")
  - Option B: Provide a `SENDGRID_API_KEY` directly so it can be stored as a secret
- Hook points already exist in `leads.ts` and `scheduling.ts` (add send logic after DB inserts)

## Google Calendar (Pending)

- The scheduling system uses deterministic time slot generation (Mon-Fri 9am-5pm CT)
- Booked slots are excluded via DB query — no double-booking is possible
- To integrate real Google Calendar availability:
  - Connect Google Calendar via Replit integrations (ask agent to "add Google Calendar")
  - The agent will query freebusy and create calendar events on booking

## Git & Deployment Setup

### Source of Truth

**GitHub** is the single source of truth: `WestHillsCapital/WestHillsCapital`, branch `main`.

- Replit local branch: `main` (tracking `github/main`)
- Local and GitHub are in sync — run `git status` to confirm "up to date with 'github/main'"

### History

Previously, Replit local (`master`) and GitHub (`main`) had completely divergent histories — no common ancestor. Task agents pushed directly to GitHub from isolated environments without syncing back to Replit. This was resolved by:
1. Fetching all GitHub objects locally
2. Adding `README.md` (the one file GitHub had that local didn't)
3. Force-pushing Replit's local history to `github/main` to unify into one linear history
4. Renaming local branch `master` → `main`
5. Setting upstream: `git branch --set-upstream-to=github/main main`

### Auto-Deploy Wiring

| Service | Watches | Deploys |
|---|---|---|
| **Railway** | GitHub `WestHillsCapital/WestHillsCapital` `main` | API server (`artifacts/api-server`) |
| **Vercel** | GitHub `WestHillsCapital/WestHillsCapital` `main` | Frontend (`artifacts/west-hills-capital`) |

Railway URL: `https://workspaceapi-server-production-987b.up.railway.app`

### Vercel Configuration

Root `vercel.json` controls the Vercel build:
- **Install**: `pnpm install`
- **Build**: `pnpm --filter @workspace/west-hills-capital build`
- **Output**: `artifacts/west-hills-capital/dist/public`
- **API rewrite**: `/api/(.*)` → Railway URL (so the Vercel-hosted frontend reaches Railway)
- **SPA fallback**: `/(.*)` → `/index.html`

### Git Remotes (Replit)

- `github` → `https://github.com/WestHillsCapital/WestHillsCapital.git` (push/fetch)
- `gitsafe-backup` → internal Replit backup
- `subrepl-848h6cbd` → isolated task agent communication

## Deal Builder — Lock & Execute Chain (Task #12)

When the internal user clicks **Lock & Execute** in the Deal Builder, the following synchronous pipeline runs server-side:

1. **DB save** — deal inserted with all fields including ship-to address
2. **DG LockPrices** — locks Fiztrade wholesale prices (20-second window)
3. **DG ExecuteTrade** — places the wholesale buy order immediately after lock
4. **Invoice PDF** — `pdfkit` generates a WHC-branded invoice (no DG references); wire instructions reference Commerce Bank account (hardcoded in `lib/invoice-pdf.ts`)
5. **Google Drive upload** — PDF saved to `{YEAR}/{MM–Month}/{FI LastName}/{MMDDYY FI LastName Invoice.pdf}` under root folder ID (e.g. `2026/04 – April/J Smith/041526 J Smith Invoice.pdf`)
6. **Client recap email** — PDF attached, with wire instructions; sent via Resend
7. **Admin notification + Sheets sync** — fire-and-forget

### Key files
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/fiztrade.ts` — LockPrices + ExecuteTrade (defensive field-name extraction; logs raw responses)
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/invoice-pdf.ts` — pdfkit invoice (Commerce Bank wire instructions hardcoded)
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/google-drive.ts` — Drive folder hierarchy + upload
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/email.ts` — attachment support + `sendDealRecapEmail`
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/deals.ts` — full orchestration pipeline

### Railway env vars required for full functionality
| Var | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DILLON_GAGE_API_KEY` | (set in Railway) | Fiztrade token |
| `GOOGLE_DRIVE_DEALS_FOLDER_ID` | `13CrCk1OVZDiSVK6zk44d7YEaDdyGo9sp` | Root Drive folder |
| `FEDEX_CLIENT_ID` | `l7b9d07dbde93c4446a649934cb2898d02` | FedEx API key |
| `FEDEX_CLIENT_SECRET` | `3cc1d6e0832545d588a79e9ccdfefa32` | FedEx secret |

### Google Drive sharing requirement
The service account `whc-scheduling@mapdrive-380403.iam.gserviceaccount.com` must have **Editor** access to the root Drive folder `13CrCk1OVZDiSVK6zk44d7YEaDdyGo9sp`.

### FedEx Location Search
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/fedex/locations` (requires internal auth)
- **Flow**: FedEx OAuth (client_credentials) → POST `https://apis.fedex.com/location/v1/locations`
- **Filter**: `locationTypes: ["FEDEX_OFFICE", "SHIP_CENTER"]` — only these two types shown
- **Result**: Up to 2 nearest locations sorted by distance; raw response logged at `INFO`
- **Deal Builder UI**: ZIP search → 2 clickable result cards → auto-fills ship-to address + fedex_location name
- **Credentials stored**: `FEDEX_CLIENT_ID`, `FEDEX_CLIENT_SECRET` in Replit env vars and Railway

### Fiztrade API note
`lib/fiztrade.ts` implements LockPrices and ExecuteTrade based on the existing API pattern. The raw responses are logged at `INFO` level in Railway. If the API returns field names different from what was assumed, check Railway logs and adjust the `pickField(...)` calls in `fiztrade.ts`.

### Commerce Bank wire instructions
Hardcoded in `lib/invoice-pdf.ts` and `lib/email.ts`:
- Bank: Commerce Bank, 1551 Waterfront, Wichita, KS 67206
- Routing: 101000019 | Account: 690108249
- Account Name: West Hills Capital, 1314 N. Oliver Ave. #8348, Wichita, KS 67208

## Business Rules

- NO cart, checkout, or payment flows
- ALL trades require verbal confirmation and cleared funds
- Phone 800-867-6768 must appear in header, footer, and confirmation screens
- No fear marketing, countdown timers, or "limited supply" language
- Products: 1oz Gold American Eagle, 1oz Gold American Buffalo, 1oz Silver American Eagle

## Bug Fixes Applied

- `h-13` non-standard Tailwind class in Home.tsx → corrected to `h-12`
- Dead `animationDelay` style and unused `idx` variable removed from LivePricing.tsx product card map
- API image URLs from `/api/pricing/products` return root-relative paths (e.g. `/images/gold-eagle.png`); `useProductPrices` hook now prepends `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` to correctly resolve them under the `/west-hills-capital/` base path
- `staleTime: 4000` added to all three pricing queries (spot, products, buyback) to prevent unnecessary refetch flicker
- State of Residence in Schedule.tsx converted from free-text Input to a native `<select>` with all 50 US states
- State field in IRA.tsx also converted from free-text Input to a native `<select>` with all 50 US states
- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service sections added to Disclosures.tsx with `id="privacy-policy"` and `id="terms-of-service"` anchors and `scroll-mt-24` for proper offset under the fixed header
- Footer links updated to `/disclosures#privacy-policy` and `/disclosures#terms-of-service`
- `ScrollToTop` in App.tsx updated to skip scrolling when `window.location.hash` is present so anchor links navigate correctly
